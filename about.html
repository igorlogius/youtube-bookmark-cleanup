Remove Duplicate Youtube Video Bookmarks from a folder

<b>Usage:</b>

Right click on a bookmark folder and in the context menu, click on "Youtube
Bookmark Cleanup". Only bookmarks which are direct children will be checked by
comparing the vid=` URL parameters. After a bookmark with a `vid` parameter is
found, any other bookmark with the same `vid` will be removed.
