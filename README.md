Remove Duplicate Youtube Video Bookmarks from a folder.

<b>Usage:</b>

Right click on a bookmark folder and in the context menu, click on "Youtube Bookmark Cleanup". 
Only bookmarks which are direct children will be checked. Only the `vid=` URL parameter is used to determine if a url already exists.
After one bookmark with a `vid` parameter if found, any other url with the same parameter will be removed.
